<p>The Boneways stretched on endlessly, a labyrinth of forgotten tunnels and crumbling passageways buried deep beneath Perdition Prime. As Kieran, Lira, and Jak moved cautiously through the gloom, the air grew colder, thick with the scent of rust and decay. The only sounds were the distant hum of ancient machinery and the quiet shuffle of their footsteps on the corroded metal floor.</p>

<p>Kieran’s pulse pounded in his ears. They had managed to evade the Servitor for now, but he knew it wouldn’t stop hunting them. It never stopped.</p>

<p>“How much farther?” Lira asked, her voice barely more than a whisper.</p>

<p>“Not far,” Kieran replied, glancing at the cracked datapad he had pulled from his coat. The map of the Boneways flickered uncertainly, but the blinking dot indicating their destination—the old data hub in Sector E-12—was growing closer. “Maybe another half-mile.”</p>

<p>Lira nodded, her cybernetic eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. Jak trudged along beside her, his small frame tense with fear. He hadn’t said much since they found him, but Kieran could see the questions simmering beneath the surface.</p>

<p>“Are we going to die down here?” Jak asked suddenly, his voice breaking the uneasy silence.</p>

<p>Lira shot Kieran a look, as if to say, Well, you’re the scientist. You handle this one.</p>

<p>Kieran sighed. “Not if we stick to the plan,” he said. “Once we reach the data hub, I’ll access the central network and send out a pulse to disable the Servitor’s tracking systems. After that, we can make our way back to the surface.”</p>

<p>“And then what?” Jak pressed. “The enforcers will still be up there. The Architect will still be looking for you.”</p>

<p>Kieran didn’t have an answer to that. The truth was, he hadn’t thought that far ahead. One crisis at a time.</p>

<p>“We’ll figure it out,” Lira said, giving Jak a reassuring pat on the shoulder. “We always do.”</p>

<p>Jak didn’t look convinced, but he fell silent and kept walking.</p>

<p>They reached the data hub a short time later—a massive, rusted doorway set into the side of the tunnel. The words <em>Central Access Node – Sector E-12</em> were barely visible beneath layers of grime and corrosion. Kieran pulled a multitool from his belt and began working on the locking mechanism, his fingers trembling slightly.</p>

<p>“Hurry up,” Lira muttered, glancing nervously back down the tunnel.</p>

<p>“I’m trying,” Kieran said through gritted teeth. The lock was old, but it had been designed to withstand tampering. After what felt like an eternity, there was a soft click, and the door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit chamber beyond.</p>

<p>They slipped inside, and Kieran sealed the door behind them, jamming another piece of metal into the locking mechanism for good measure.</p>

<p>The data hub was a relic of a bygone era, a cavernous space filled with rows of towering server banks and flickering holo-screens. Thick cables snaked across the floor, connecting ancient consoles to power sources that shouldn’t have been functional anymore—but somehow still were. The air was heavy with the hum of electricity and the faint, acrid smell of burning circuits.</p>

<p>Kieran moved quickly to one of the central consoles, brushing away a layer of dust before activating it. The screen flickered to life, displaying lines of code and diagnostic readouts in a language that hadn’t been used in decades.</p>

<p>“Can you do it?” Lira asked, peering over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I think so,” Kieran said, his fingers flying across the keyboard. “I just need to access the mainframe and send out a deactivation pulse. It should scramble the Servitor’s systems long enough for us to get away.”</p>

<p>“And if it doesn’t?” Jak asked nervously.</p>

<p>Kieran didn’t answer. He didn’t need to.</p>

<p>For several tense minutes, the only sound was the clatter of Kieran’s fingers on the keyboard. Lira paced near the door, her pistol at the ready, while Jak hovered nervously nearby.</p>

<p>Finally, Kieran leaned back with a sigh of relief. “Got it. The pulse is ready to go. I just need to—”</p>

<p>A sudden, deafening crash cut him off as the door exploded inward, torn from its hinges by a massive, clawed hand.</p>

<p>The Servitor stepped into the chamber, its red visor blazing like a demon’s eye. Sparks flickered along its damaged limbs, and its synthetic flesh hung in tatters, revealing the gleaming metal skeleton beneath.</p>

<p>“RUN!” Lira shouted, firing off several shots as Kieran grabbed Jak and pulled him toward the back of the room.</p>

<p>The shots ricocheted harmlessly off the Servitor’s armored chassis. It let out a mechanical screech and lunged forward, its claws slicing through one of the server banks like it was made of paper.</p>

<p>Kieran and Jak dove behind a console as Lira continued to fire, trying to draw the Servitor’s attention. But it was too fast. In the blink of an eye, it closed the distance between them, its clawed hand lashing out and knocking her weapon from her grasp.</p>

<p>Lira dodged the next attack, but she wasn’t quick enough to avoid the third. The Servitor’s claws raked across her side, sending her crashing into the wall with a gasp of pain.</p>

<p>“Lira!” Kieran shouted, his heart pounding in his chest.</p>

<p>The Servitor turned toward him, its head twitching as it scanned the room. Kieran could see the flickering glow of its damaged circuitry, and an idea began to form in his mind—a desperate, reckless idea.</p>

<p>“Jak, listen to me,” he said urgently. “I need you to stay here and keep your head down. No matter what happens, don’t move.”</p>

<p>Jak’s eyes widened. “What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to finish what I started.”</p>

<p>Before Jak could protest, Kieran stood up and sprinted toward the console at the center of the room. The Servitor let out another mechanical screech and charged after him, its claws tearing through the air inches from his back.</p>

<p>Kieran reached the console and slammed his hand down on the activation switch. The pulse generator roared to life, sending out a shockwave of energy that rippled through the room.</p>

<p>The Servitor froze mid-stride, its limbs twitching violently as the pulse scrambled its systems. Sparks flew from its damaged circuitry, and its red visor flickered and dimmed.</p>

<p>For a moment, Kieran thought it was over.</p>

<p>Then the Servitor let out a low, guttural growl and took another step forward.</p>

<p>“It’s not working!” Lira shouted, struggling to her feet.</p>

<p>Kieran’s mind raced. The pulse wasn’t strong enough to disable the Servitor completely—but maybe, just maybe, it could be amplified.</p>

<p>“Get to the power core!” he shouted to Lira. “We need to overload the system!”</p>

<p>Lira nodded, grimacing in pain as she limped toward the back of the room. Jak followed, his small hands gripping the edges of Lira’s coat as they moved.</p>

<p>Kieran held his ground, buying them time as he continued to manipulate the console, pushing the pulse generator to its limits.</p>

<p>The Servitor let out one final, earsplitting screech and lunged at him—but before it could strike, a blinding flash of light filled the room as the power core overloaded.</p>

<p>The shockwave tore through the chamber, engulfing the Servitor in a storm of energy. Its body convulsed violently, and with one final, glitching roar, it collapsed to the ground in a heap of sparking metal.</p>

<p>Kieran slumped against the console, his chest heaving.</p>

<p>“It’s… it’s over,” Jak whispered, his voice trembling.</p>

<p>“For now,” Lira said, her expression grim. “But the Architect will send more.”</p>

<p>Kieran nodded, staring down at the remains of the Servitor. They had won this battle—but the war was far from over. He met Lira’s gaze, and for the first time in a long while, he saw a flicker of hope.</p>

<p>“We’ll be ready,” he said, determination hardening his voice. “Whatever comes next… we’ll face it together.”</p>

<p>And in the ruins of the Boneways, beneath the decaying heart of Perdition Prime, the spark of rebellion was born.</p>
