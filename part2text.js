<p>The echoes of heavy footfalls reverberated through the smog-filled alleys of the Rusted Sprawl as Kieran and Lira sprinted deeper into the city’s decaying underbelly. Behind them, the metallic shrieks and mechanical clanking of the Servitor filled the air, growing louder with each passing second. It wasn’t just chasing them—it was hunting them with cold, relentless efficiency.</p>

<p>Lira darted through a narrow gap between two crumbling buildings, her cybernetic eyes glowing faintly in the dim light. Kieran followed, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Every step sent spikes of pain through his exhausted legs, but he didn’t dare stop. Not now. Not when death—or something worse—was so close behind.</p>

<p>“Where’s the hatch?” he managed to choke out, his voice barely audible over the pounding of his heart.</p>

<p>“Two more blocks!” Lira shouted back, not breaking her stride.</p>

<p>Ahead, the alley opened into a wide, dilapidated square. The flickering remnants of an old holo-advertisement cast ghostly blue light across the rusted metal ground. A group of scavengers huddled near a burned-out transport, their faces hidden beneath makeshift respirators. They watched with weary disinterest as Kieran and Lira barreled past, too accustomed to violence and desperation to be surprised.</p>

<p>But the calm didn’t last.</p>

<p>A deafening metallic screech split the air as the Servitor burst into the square, its elongated limbs twitching unnaturally as it scanned the area. The scavengers scattered, vanishing into the shadows like rats fleeing a sinking ship.</p>

<p>Lira grabbed Kieran’s arm and yanked him toward a rusted maintenance ladder bolted to the side of an old factory wall. “Climb!”</p>

<p>Kieran didn’t need to be told twice. He scrambled up the ladder, his boots slipping on the slick metal as he hauled himself upward. Below, the Servitor tilted its head, its glowing red visor locking onto them with unsettling precision.</p>

<p>As Kieran reached the top, Lira swung herself onto the rooftop beside him and immediately dropped to one knee, pulling a small, crudely modified energy pistol from her belt.</p>

<p>“Go!” she hissed, gesturing toward the far side of the rooftop.</p>

<p>“What about you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll slow it down. Just get to the hatch!”</p>

<p>Kieran hesitated for a fraction of a second, torn between the instinct to run and the guilt of leaving her behind. But he knew she was right. If they both stayed, they were dead.</p>

<p>He turned and sprinted across the rooftop, the rusted metal groaning beneath his feet. Behind him, he heard the sharp crack of Lira’s pistol as she opened fire.</p>

<p>The Servitor didn’t flinch. It moved with terrifying speed, scaling the wall with its clawed mechanical hands as though gravity were little more than a suggestion.</p>

<p>Lira cursed and fired again, aiming for the exposed hydraulics in its legs. Sparks flew as one of the shots connected, but the damage was minimal. The Servitor’s movements faltered for less than a second before it continued its ascent, its red visor glowing brighter, as though in anger.</p>

<p>Kieran reached the edge of the rooftop and dropped down onto a lower platform, landing hard on his side. Pain shot through his ribs, but he forced himself to his feet and kept moving. Below, he could see the hatch—an old maintenance access point leading down into the Boneways, the network of abandoned tunnels and service corridors that crisscrossed beneath Perdition Prime.</p>

<p>Lira landed beside him a moment later, her breathing ragged but steady. “Come on!”</p>

<p>They sprinted toward the hatch, their boots clanging against the metal platform. Kieran reached it first, yanking open the rusted cover with a grunt of effort.</p>

<p>“You first,” Lira said, glancing back over her shoulder. The Servitor was already on the rooftop above them, its head twitching as it calculated its next move.</p>

<p>Kieran didn’t argue. He dropped into the hatch, sliding down a corroded metal ladder and landing in the dimly lit tunnel below. The air down here was colder, thicker, filled with the acrid scent of old machinery and stagnant water.</p>

<p>A moment later, Lira landed beside him, pulling the hatch shut behind her. She jammed a length of metal pipe into the locking mechanism, bracing it against the frame.</p>

<p>“That won’t hold it for long,” she said, wiping sweat and grime from her face.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t have to,” Kieran replied. “We just need a head start.”</p>

<p>Lira gave him a grim nod, and they set off down the tunnel, their footsteps echoing in the dark.</p>

<p>The Boneways were a labyrinth—an endless maze of crumbling infrastructure, forgotten by the city above. Old maintenance bots lay rusting in the corners, their power cells long since depleted. Broken conduits and tangled wiring hung from the ceiling like mechanical vines.</p>

<p>As they moved deeper, the sound of their pursuer grew fainter, though Kieran knew better than to believe they were safe. The Servitor wasn’t the only danger down here.</p>

<p>After several minutes of walking in tense silence, they reached a junction where several tunnels converged. A rusted sign hung crookedly on the wall, its faded lettering barely legible: <em>Sector C-7 Access Point.</em></p>

<p>“We should rest here for a minute,” Lira said, leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>Kieran nodded, collapsing onto a nearby crate. His legs felt like lead, and his lungs burned from the effort of running through the toxic air.</p>

<p>“We need a plan,” Lira said, her voice low. “The Boneways might keep us hidden for a while, but it’s only a matter of time before that thing finds another way down here.”</p>

<p>Kieran rubbed his temples, trying to think through the haze of exhaustion. “There’s a data hub in Sector E-12,” he said after a moment. “If I can get access, I might be able to disable the Servitor remotely—or at least slow it down.”</p>

<p>Lira raised an eyebrow. “And how exactly do you plan to do that?”</p>

<p>Kieran hesitated. He hadn’t told her everything. Not yet.</p>

<p>Before he could answer, a low rumble echoed through the tunnel, followed by the sound of approaching footsteps. But these weren’t the heavy, mechanical footfalls of the Servitor.</p>

<p>They were lighter. Quicker.</p>

<p>Lira drew her pistol, her eyes narrowing. “We’re not alone.”</p>

<p>A figure emerged from the shadows—a young boy, no more than twelve, with messy blond hair and wide, fearful eyes. His clothes were torn and filthy, and he clutched a small, battered datapad to his chest like it was the most precious thing in the world.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” he cried, holding up his hands. “Please, I—I’m not here to hurt you!”</p>

<p>Kieran exchanged a glance with Lira, then stepped forward cautiously. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Jak,” the boy said, his voice trembling. “I’ve been hiding down here ever since the enforcers came to my sector. They… they killed everyone.”</p>

<p>Lira’s expression softened slightly, but she kept her weapon raised. “Why are you following us?”</p>

<p>“I saw you drop down from the hatch,” Jak said. “I thought maybe… maybe you could help me.”</p>

<p>Kieran sighed. Another complication. But they couldn’t just leave the kid here.</p>

<p>“Alright, Jak,” he said. “You can come with us. But you need to stay quiet and do exactly as we say. Understand?”</p>

<p>Jak nodded quickly. “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lira lowered her pistol with a sigh. “Great. More dead weight.”</p>

<p>They set off down the tunnel again, this time with Jak in tow. Kieran just hoped they’d reach the data hub before the Servitor caught up with them—or before something even worse found them first.</p>
