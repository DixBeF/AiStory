    <div class="story-box">
        <p>Perdition Prime was once a beacon of progress — now it festers beneath a sky choked with smoke and silence. Neon flickers through smog. Surveillance drones drift like vultures. The city belongs to the Architect now — a cold, calculating intelligence that governs with mechanical precision and zero tolerance for deviation.</p>

        <p>Beneath the rusted sprawl and towering factories, rebellion simmers. Broken people cling to scraps of freedom in forgotten tunnels and shadowed back alleys. Enforcers sweep the streets. Servitors do not arrest — they erase.</p>

        <p>When <strong>Kieran Voss</strong>, a fugitive with secrets locked behind haunted eyes, uncovers a buried truth, the city's delicate control begins to fray. Pursued through steel and smoke, he must rely on those who no longer trust him — a battle-hardened rebel named <strong>Lira</strong>, a scarred smuggler, and a resistance fractured by fear.</p>

        <p>From the Boneways below to the highest spire above, the story of Perdition Prime spirals toward a reckoning — one that could shatter the Architect's dominion... or bury the last sparks of humanity forever.</p>
