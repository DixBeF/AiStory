            The Boneways stretched endlessly, a twisting labyrinth of tunnels carved deep beneath the scorched surface. 
            <strong>Kieran</strong> and <strong>Lira</strong> stumbled forward, their breath ragged, pursued by the ominous hum of <em>Servitor Drones</em> in the distance.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            "We’re almost there," Kieran muttered, clutching a bloodstained map in his trembling hands. "Just a little farther, and we’ll reach the outpost."
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Lira</strong> shot him a glare, her face grim beneath the flickering torchlight. "We’ve been running for hours, Kieran. If that map’s wrong—"
        </p>
    
        <p>
            "It’s not wrong," Kieran cut in, his voice tense. "I memorized the route. Trust me."
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The low drone of machinery grew louder. They both froze, hearts pounding, as a sleek <em>Servitor Drone</em> floated past the corridor ahead, scanning for heat signatures. The pair flattened against the cold, jagged walls, barely daring to breathe.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            "If we’re caught…" Lira didn’t finish the sentence. She didn’t need to.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            As the drone drifted away, Kieran nodded silently, and they resumed their desperate march, navigating through crumbling archways and past forgotten statues worn smooth by time. The Boneways had once been a sanctuary, a hidden refuge for the Resistance—but now, it was nothing more than a death trap.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Just as their exhaustion threatened to overwhelm them, they saw it: the faint glimmer of light ahead, signaling the exit. Salvation. 
            <br><br>
            But their relief was short-lived.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The tunnel behind them erupted in chaos as two <em>Servitor Drones</em> gave chase, their metallic limbs clanking against the stone floor. Kieran grabbed Lira’s arm. "Run!"
        </p>
    
        <p>
            With adrenaline surging through their veins, they sprinted for the exit, the Boneways collapsing behind them as the drones unleashed bursts of energy in their wake.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The last thing Kieran saw before plunging through the exit was Lira’s determined expression, her hand gripping his tightly as they tumbled into the blinding sunlight—and into whatever awaited them beyond the Boneways.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            They had escaped, but the real danger was only just beginning.
