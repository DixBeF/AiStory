            A thick haze of smog clung to the streets of Perdition Prime, turning the neon signs overhead into little more than blurred ghosts of color. 
            The air reeked of burning metal, of oil and sweat, of the slow rot of a city that had long since stopped pretending to care for those who lived in its lower depths. 
            The towering factories belched out black smoke in steady intervals, choking the sky, sealing the district beneath a dome of perpetual dusk.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            In the heart of the Rusted Sprawl, <strong>Kieran Voss</strong> moved like a hunted animal. His tattered longcoat was pulled tight against his body, his breath raspy from the toxic air. 
            He hadn’t slept in days—not properly. His hands trembled, not from fear, but from whatever chemical exposure had settled into his bones over the years.
        </p>
    
        <p><em>He knew they were close.</em></p>
    
        <p>
            The Enforcers had been combing the district all night. He’d seen the sweep teams moving through the alleyways, their steel-plated boots clanking against rusted walkways, 
            their gas-masked faces expressionless as they scanned the filth for signs of their target.  
        </p>
    
        <p><strong>For him.</strong></p>
    
        <p>
            Kieran ducked into the shadows of a derelict maintenance corridor, pressing his back against a wall slick with condensation and grime. He exhaled slowly, forcing his pulse to settle.  
        </p>
    
        <p><em>I just need to find Lira.</em></p>
    
        <p>
            She was his only chance of getting out of here alive. She knew the tunnels beneath Perdition Prime better than anyone. If anyone could get him past the enforcer patrols and into the Boneways, it was her.  
            The problem was, she didn’t trust him. Not after what had happened the last time they crossed paths.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            A deep mechanical hum echoed through the alley, and Kieran stilled. A patrol drone drifted past the entrance, its red scanner sweeping methodically through the smog. He held his breath, pressing himself deeper into the dark. 
            The drone hesitated—then moved on.
        </p>
    
        <p><em>Not yet,</em> he thought. <em>Not yet, but soon.</em></p>
    
        <p>
            He turned down another alley, slipping into the back entrance of a run-down bar called <strong>The Sulfur Pit.</strong> The place was dimly lit, its walls layered in years of cigarette smoke and industrial grime. 
            The patrons were the usual mix of factory workers, scavengers, and black-market tech dealers—people who had given up trying to escape the city and instead carved out their own brand of existence in the filth.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            At the far end of the room, behind a table littered with half-empty shot glasses and spent power cells, sat the person he was looking for.  
            <strong>Lira Kastra.</strong>  
        </p>
    
        <p>
            She was hunched over a small holoscreen, its dim blue light reflecting off the dull cybernetic implants embedded beneath the skin of her temples. Her tangled black hair fell over one side of her face, 
            half-hiding the faint orange glow of her failing ocular enhancements. Her patched-up industrial armor was layered with scavenged plating, a stark reminder that trust didn’t come easy in this part of the city.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Across from her sat a broad-shouldered man in a stained miner’s jumpsuit, his face half-hidden behind a rebreather mask. <strong>Orlan Kett</strong>—one of the last remaining independent smugglers in the Sprawl.  
            If Kieran had any hope of slipping through the cracks in the city’s surveillance, he needed both of them.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Lira looked up as he approached, her glowing eyes narrowing.  
            “No.”  
        </p>
    
        <p>Kieran hesitated. “I haven’t said anything yet.”</p>
    
        <p>
            She leaned back in her chair, exhaling through her teeth. “You don’t have to. You’re desperate, you need my help, and whatever mess you’re tangled in is going to put a price on my head. So no.”  
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Orlan chuckled, his voice distorted through the rebreather. “She’s got you figured out, Voss.”  
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Kieran pulled up a chair, ignoring the discomfort of their stares. “Listen. I don’t have time to argue. The enforcers are out for blood, and I have something they don’t want getting out.”  
        </p>
    
        <p>Lira sighed, rubbing her temples. “What did you do?”</p>
    
        <p>
            “I found something in the system,” Kieran said, lowering his voice. “Buried in the archives. It’s proof that—”  
        </p>
    
        <p>The front door of the bar slammed open.</p>
    
        <p>The murmur of conversation died instantly.</p>
    
        <p>Three figures stepped inside, their heavy footfalls echoing against the steel floor...</p>
